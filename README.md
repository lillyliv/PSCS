# PSCS
Peoples Secure Computing System is a free operating system for the people, by the people for x86 Intel/AMD compatible systems. It runs in 16 bit real mode and boots from floppy or bios emulated floppy (happens automatically) and supports vga text and graphics.

## Build Dependencies

PSCS only requires an up to date version of NASM to build and qemu-system-x86_64 to run. Currently the binary takes up a little less than 1KiB so disk space shouldnt be a problem.
